# SNAKE GAME

* the game has a START button that starts the game (at the beginning or after the end of previous round)
* the game has a snake that is a chain of segments that follow each other
* the snake moves by itself in one of 4 directions: North, East, South, and WEST
* arrow keys change the direction of the snake
* there are random elements (different types at random locations) that snake should eat "food" or avoid "poison" (the number of them could be set in your source code constants); different types of elements should look different
* if the snake eats an element it grows 1 to 3 segments, if it hits an element to avoid the snake dies
* you win if there is nothing eatable left, you loose if you hit a "poison", or boundary, or reverse the direction 180 degrees
* the score is the size of the snake
* you should remember high score
* ADVANCED: upon a win, you present a new and more challenging board and the game continues after a nice and short message
* ADVANCED: you can connect to another player over the network and then you can play against each other (game rules are yours to define)
